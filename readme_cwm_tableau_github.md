# Data Visualization with Tableau: Saving Superstore

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp**.  
The fictional Superstore is on the brink of bankruptcy, and I was hired as a consultant to identify ways to increase profitability and reduce operational inefficiencies.

The goal was to:
- Identify the biggest profit centers and loss-makers.
- Recommend which products and categories to focus on or discontinue.
- Determine if targeted advertising would be worth the investment.
- Investigate product return patterns and their impact on profitability.

## Key Features & Functionality
- **Profitability Analysis**  
  Determined the top-performing and underperforming product-region combinations using Tableau visualizations.
  
- **Advertising ROI Simulation**  
  Calculated and visualized Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) to identify optimal advertising periods and regions.

- **Product Returns Investigation**  
  Analyzed return rates by product, customer, and other dimensions to identify patterns and problem areas.
- **Actionable Recommendations**  
  Provided evidence-backed suggestions for discontinuing certain products, investing in advertising in specific regions and months, and targeting return-reduction measures.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Tableau Public** ‚Äî Data visualization & dashboard creation
- **Excel** ‚Äî Initial data exploration
- **Analytical Techniques** ‚Äî ROAS calculation, profitability ranking, return rate computation, LEFT JOIN operations for returns analysis
- **Storytelling with Data** ‚Äî Creating a logical, visual narrative

---

## Insights & Findings
- Certain product subcategories and shipping methods generated consistent losses.
- Three state-month combinations showed high enough profit margins to justify advertising spend.
- A small set of products and customers accounted for disproportionately high return rates.
- Eliminating low-margin products and targeting advertising could significantly improve profitability.
