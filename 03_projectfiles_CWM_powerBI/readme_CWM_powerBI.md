# Power BI: Shopify App Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp**.  
I was tasked with analyzing data scraped from the Shopify App Store to identify factors that influence the success of Shopify apps. The analysis explored app landscape trends, review patterns, and developer responsiveness to uncover opportunities for improvement and growth.

The objective was to:
- Understand the distribution and characteristics of Shopify apps.
- Examine relationships between ratings, review volume, and developer responsiveness.
- Identify top-performing developers and potential improvement areas.

## Key Features & Functionality
- **App Landscape Overview**  
  Created KPIs and visualizations to highlight the number of apps, review activity over time, and the correlation between review count and ratings.

- **Developer Responsiveness Analysis**  
  Measured the impact of developer engagement on app ratings, using calculated DAX columns to track reply behavior.

- **Performance by Developer**  
  Compared developers based on average ratings, weighted reviews, and helpful review metrics.

- **Interactive Insights**  
  Designed an intuitive, multi-page Power BI report that allows users to filter by developer, category, and performance metric.
