Hi there, Wazim. 

Nice to make your acquaintance here in the readme to review comments dialogue. Mainly, I wanted to do my best without any direction or comment. So I uploading my best attempt from how I visualized the project at the beginning. Maybe that is good enough, maybe not. 

I look forward to talking about where I can improve and hearing some advice or tips. 

There is a pdf titled: Zomato_report. That is the POWERBI report exported from the program. 

I see why Triple ten suggests screen shots because I seem to have to get the upgraded version to share a dashboard or even make one. Also, directly after this I am going to do the analysis over again on Tableau for practice and just in case I submit again.

file name: data_Zomato_good
This is the data that I cleaned and used in Power BI to analyze and visualize.

Finally, file name: 

cmw_Zomato Restaurant Performance Analysis

This is the pdf of the presentation script which discusses the analysis and the findings and the conclusions of the Zomato restaurant report. 

a link to the Power BI project should you be able to access.
