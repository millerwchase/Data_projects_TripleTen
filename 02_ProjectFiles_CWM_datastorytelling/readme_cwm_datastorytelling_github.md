# Data Storytelling with Tableau: Superstore's Returns

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp**.  
The fictional Superstore has been experiencing a high volume of returned orders. I was tasked with uncovering the root causes of returns and presenting the findings in a way that the CEO and management team could quickly understand and act upon.

The objective was to:
- Identify patterns and drivers behind customer returns.
- Examine how returns vary by product, customer type, location, and time.
- Present actionable insights via an interactive Tableau dashboard.
- Build a data story arc for executive decision-making.

## Key Features & Functionality
- **Root Cause Analysis**  
  Identified key product categories, customer segments, and regions contributing to high return rates.

- **Geographic & Seasonal Trends**  
  Visualized return rates across states and months to detect location-based or seasonal patterns.

- **Customer Behavior Insights**  
  Highlighted high-return customers and potential strategies to mitigate repeat returns.

- **Executive Storytelling**  
  Designed a dashboard that clearly communicates findings and supports filtering by multiple dimensions.
